# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Dashboard

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital emergency room (ER) data to identify patient inflow patterns, resource utilization, and emergency trends.  
I used **Power Query** for data cleaning, **Data Modeling** to establish relationships, and built an **Excel Dashboard** to visualize key metrics.

## 🔎 Problem
Hospitals face challenges in managing emergency departments due to:
- Unpredictable patient inflows
- Resource allocation (doctors, nurses, beds)
- Identifying peak hours and common emergencies

---

## ⚙️ Analysis Approach
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Cleaned raw hospital data using **Power Query** (handled nulls, standardized dates, removed duplicates).  
   - Built a structured dataset ready for analysis.

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Created relationships between tables (Patients, Admissions, Resources).  
   - Applied calculated columns & measures for KPIs.

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Designed a single-page interactive Excel dashboard with slicers & KPIs.  
   - Visuals include:
     - Patient inflow by time & day
     - Emergency cases by category
     - Average waiting & treatment time
     - Resource utilization

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🚑 Peak emergency inflow occurs between **6 PM – 10 PM**.  
- 🩺 **Trauma & Cardiac cases** contribute to ~45% of emergencies.  
- ⏳ Average waiting time reduced by **15%** when staff scheduling was optimized.  

---

## 💡 Business Value
- Improved **staff allocation** during peak hours.  
- Data-driven **resource planning** (beds, doctors, nurses).  
- Enhanced **patient care experience** through reduced wait times.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Excel** (Power Query, PivotTables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)  
- **Data Modeling** in Excel  
- **Data Visualization** for storytelling
